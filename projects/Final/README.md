The final is due Monday, the 12th of November.  The precise due
time is 11:59pm of the due day.

All of your code should be stored in the Final/MySolution directory.

Your final project is expected to be built on top of your midterm project.
If you midterm project is unfinished, please finish it first. If you need
help to do so or just have some questions, please do not hesitate to contact
me ASAP.
